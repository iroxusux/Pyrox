please write a python script that can analyze my l5x file.

Edit
I'll create a Python script that can analyze your L5X file to find redundant OTEs (Output Energize instructions). This script will parse the XML structure of your L5X file and identify any cases where the same output tag is used in multiple OTE instructions.


L5X Redundant OTE Analyzer
Code 
This Python script will analyze your L5X file to find redundant OTE (Output Energize) instructions throughout your PLC program. Here's how it works:

Features
Parses the XML structure of L5X files
Identifies all OTE instructions across all programs and routines
Finds cases where the same tag is used in multiple OTE instructions
Provides location details including program name, routine name, and rung number
Includes rung description/comments for context
Saves a detailed report to a text file for easy reference
How to Use
Save the script to a file named l5x_redundant_ote_analyzer.py
Run it from your command line by passing your L5X file as an argument:
python l5x_redundant_ote_analyzer.py path/to/your/file.L5X
The script will create a report file in the same directory as your L5X file
Requirements
Python 3.x
No additional packages required (uses only standard library)
This script should work with any L5X file, regardless of size, since it processes the file on your local machine. The script is also efficient with memory usage, so it should handle your 53MB file without issues.
